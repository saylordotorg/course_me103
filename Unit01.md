**Unit 1: Introduction to Thermodynamics** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin by taking a look at important thermodynamic concepts and
terminology that you will use throughout the course.  We will use what
are known as systems to define our realms of analysis.  A thermodynamic
system is any bounded area that we place under observation.  Systems
come in a number of variations.  If, for example, mass is not allowed to
enter or exit the region under examination, the system is considered a
“closed” system.  If mass is allowed to transfer across the boundaries
of the area, however, it is an “open” system.*  
 *             
 This unit will also define and examine thermodynamic properties and
states and review common units, relationships, and conversions that you
will need to recognize and perform in this course.  For example, how do
you define pressure?  How can we make conversions between SI and USCS
units?  You may be familiar with some or all of these; if this is the
case, use this section as a refresher. *
