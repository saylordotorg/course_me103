**Unit 4: First Law of Thermodynamics** <span id="4"></span> 
*Thermodynamics operates according to two main laws.  In this unit, we
will take an in-depth look at the first of these, which states that
energy is conserved.  In other words, energy can be altered and
transformed, but it can never be created or destroyed.  For example, an
apple contains a certain amount of potential energy.  If you eat the
apple, you digest it and, after a series of processes, convert the
apple’s potential energy into the kinetic energy that powers you when
you walk around.  The apple’s potential energy was not lost; it was
merely changed into another form.*  
 *             
 The first law sets an upper limit on the interconversion of different
forms of energy and work.  It is often paraphrased as “You can’t win;”
that is, you “can’t get something for nothing.”  Understanding this
concept is as fundamental to science and engineering work as balancing
an account is to finance.*

     Instructions: Read these articles. Links to examples at the end of
    each document illustrate the concepts involved for a few
    thermodynamic power cycles. Closed systems do not allow any mass
    transfer into or out of them, while open systems do. In a closed
    system (imagine, for example, the gas trapped inside a piston
    chamber), the volume can change, but the mass cannot.
