**Unit 3: Energy Transfer Through Work, Heat, and Mass** <span
id="3"></span> 
*For our purposes, energy is a substance that has the potential to
change the state of a system, depending on its motion into and out of
the defined area of analysis.  In this unit, we will learn to quantify
and observe energy as it affects the studied area.  
              
 Energy is transferred into and around a system by work transfer and
heat transfer.  Thermodynamics studies the transfer of work and heat in
and out of systems and how it affects the properties of the systems.  *

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on “Study Guide for Chapter 3.”  Please
    read pages 3–10 to pages 3–26.  In this reading, you will learn
    about energy transfer through work.  In mechanics, work is defined
    as a force acting on a moving body.  Imagine, for example, you are
    trying to move your desk across the room.  You will probably find it
    difficult to push the desk across the floor, and will likely be
    tired when you are finished.  However, if you only pulled the desk
    out from the wall a few inches—say to slip a cord behind it—you
    would be much less exhausted when finished.  The first example
    requires more “work” than the second.  In this unit, you will also
    learn how to calculate work for several typical processes, including
    constant volume, constant pressure, constant temperature, and
    polytropic processes.
