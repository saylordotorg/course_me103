Course Syllabus for "ME103: Thermodynamics"
-------------------------------------------

There are many different ways that you can go about solving engineering
problems.  One of the most important methods is energy analysis.  Energy
is a physical property that allows work of any kind to be done; without
it, there would be no motion, no heat, and no life.  You wouldn’t be
able to get out of bed in the morning, but it wouldn’t matter, because
there would be no sun.  Without energy, our world would not exist as it
does. Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transfers though
work.  It is the link between heat and mechanical exertion.  Once you
have a solid grasp on thermodynamic concepts, you should be able to
understand why certain mechanisms (such as engines and boilers) work the
way they do, determine how much work they can put out, and know how to
optimize these power systems.   A thorough understanding of
thermodynamics is crucial to any career that focuses on HVAC systems,
car engines, or renewable energy technology. This course will focus on
the fundamentals of thermodynamics, including the First and Second Laws,
thermodynamic properties, ideal gases, and equations of state.  We will
also take a brief look at power cycles so that you understand how these
basic concepts apply to real-world situations (i.e. how they pertain to
a steam power plant or your refrigerator).  You should note that this
class is problem-heavy.  Over the course of the semester, you will be
exposed to a number of examples that have been designed to provide you
with a visual understanding of the subject matter.  The concepts you
learn in this course will serve as the basis for more advanced
courses—Heat Transfer ([ME204](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me204/))
and Thermal-Fluid Systems
([ME303](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me303/))—that will ask you to
perform in-depth and working assessments of engineering problems.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Identify and use units and notations in thermodynamics.
-   State and illustrate the first and second laws of thermodynamics.
-   Identify and explain the concepts of entropy, enthalpy, specific
    energy, reversibility, and irreversibility.
-   Apply the first and second laws of thermodynamics to formulate and
    solve engineering problems for (i) closed systems, (ii) open systems
    under steady-state and transient conditions, and (iii) power cycles.
-   Use thermodynamic tables, charts, and equation of state (e.g. the
    ideal gas law) to obtain appropriate property data to solve
    thermodynamics problems.
