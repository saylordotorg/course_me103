**Unit 5: Second Law of Thermodynamics** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit will introduce the concept of entropy, or the “uncertainty”
of a system.  A system’s entropy—along with its temperature—can be used
to determine the amount of unusable energy that is present in that
system.  (Unusable energy is energy in the form of heat that will be
dissipated.)  The higher a system’s entropy, the more irreversible it is
considered to be.   
              
 The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy change of an
isolated system—whether open or closed—will tend to increase, or at
least remain the same.  In other words, this law states that it is
impossible for a system to see a decrease in entropy; a system will
continue to tend toward irreversibility, at least until it reaches a
state of equilibrium.*
