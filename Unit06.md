**Unit 6: Introduction to Power Cycles** <span id="6"></span> 
*This last unit of the course will introduce you to power cycles as a
means of explaining how the concepts we have learned thus far relate to
real-world problems.  A power cycle is a series of thermodynamic process
that alters a system and eventually returns it to its original state. 
By studying power cycles, we can answer questions like: what happens
when we fill up our cars with gas and then are able to drive forward? 
What is the difference between diesel and gasoline engines?  Keep in
mind, however, that this unit will serve as only an* introduction*to
power cycles.  In Thermal-Fluid Systems (a 300-level course), you will
learn about these systems in much greater detail. *
