**Unit 2: Properties of Pure Substances** <span id="2"></span> 
*The simplest thermodynamic situations involve “pure substances.”  Pure
substances are single, uncontaminated substances that have not been
mixed with any other substances.  They are fundamental building blocks
(atoms or molecules) arranged in a certain way.  Common pure substances
include water, molecular nitrogen, graphite, diamond.  We also often
have a situation in which it is convenient to treat a mixture as a
single substance (e.g air in combustion problems, impure water,
gasoline).  You must understand how to carry out pure substance
calculations prior to analyzing mixtures (this latter subject will be
addressed in future courses).*

    substance as functions of pressure, temperature, and specific

     Instructions: Please click on “Chapter 01 - Student Study Guide
    (399.0K)” to download the PPT slides. In these notes, you will be
    introduced to intensive and extensive properties of a system and
    will learn how to identify whether a property of a system is
    extensive or intensive.  There are some properties that depend on
    the size of a system, while other properties are independent of the
    size of the system.  Is volume an extensive property or an intensive
    property?
